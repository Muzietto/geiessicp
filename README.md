# geiessicp   ( _j_-_s_-SICP)

A few JS implementations from the Wizard Book:

## chapter 2
- sets && balanced trees
- the Huffman trees

NB - for the picture language see [Geiespictures](https://github.com/Muzietto/geiespictures)

## chapter 3
- constraints propagation
- digital circuits simulator

NB - arrow functions have creeped into the code, so this stuff runs only on ES6-ready browsers.
